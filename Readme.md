libft

This project, called libft, is the first project you will be doing as a student at 42. The goal of this project is to build your own C library containing a variety of functions that you will be able to use in future projects at 42.

How to use

The library contains a wide range of standard C functions, as well as some additional functions that you will need to implement yourself. Once you have compiled the library, you can simply include it in your own C projects and use the functions as needed.

To compile the library, simply run make in the root directory of the project. This will create a libft.a file in the same directory. You can then include this file in your own projects and use the functions as needed.

Functions

The library contains a variety of standard C functions, including string manipulation functions, memory allocation functions, and math functions. In addition, you will need to implement your own versions of several standard functions, such as strlen and strcpy.

For a full list of functions included in the library, as well as the functions that you will need to implement yourself, please see the libft.h header file.
